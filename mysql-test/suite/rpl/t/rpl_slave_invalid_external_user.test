# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test verifies that when applier thread tries to access 'variable_name' of
# INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSION_VARIABLES table through triggers it successfully
# retrieves all the session variables.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Steps:
#    0 - Create two tables t1 and t2.
#    1 - Create a trigger such that it reads the names of all session variables
#        from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSION_VARIABLES table and populates one of the
#        tables.
#    2 - Do a DML on master and wait for it to be replicated and ensure that
#        slave is in sync with master and it is up and running.
#
# ==== References ====

# select from I_S
